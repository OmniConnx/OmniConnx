## How to run app

In root folder:  
`npm run dev`  
Both backend Node server and React Front-End app will run concurrently. We pretty much always use this, in both production and dev environments.   

## How to run just the Node backend server

In terminal:   
`npm run server`  

## How to run just the React Front-End

In terminal:  
`cd client`  
`npm start` or `yarn start`
